## Fixed

- Wayland detection under Sway.

Change clipboard adapter to use arguments instead of STDIN, which should

blocking read.

  standard input.

# Version 2.0 (2019-07-23)

inconsistent support for the primary selection, this feature has now been
dropped and the plugin is again only doing clipboard copying.

  clipboard to let you paste it manually.
- `xdotool` as a supported adapter.

This is a large upgrade to the emoji data, which restores a few things that
went missing in version 1.1.

## Fixed

  1.1.

## Changed

- Updated to [`emoji-data`][emoji-data] version 2.0.

# Version 1.1 (2019-06-02)

First new feature release! This release does a lot of improvements and adds
some new features.

## Fixed

  - Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to copy it like before.
- Support for `xclip`.
- Experimental, untested support for Wayland via `wl-clipboard`.
- Adapter script for adding support for other clipboard manager.

## Changed
